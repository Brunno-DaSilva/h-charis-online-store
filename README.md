## Approach:

I had a defined idea of what I was looking for. An Online Store that provides users with a variety of products for men, woman, children, and house decor. 
An immersive experience, where we allow the user to select specific product by category, view the product and add to the cart, preview the items in the cart and move to the checkout,where the can remove and increment the number of items before purchase. Finally, the user can use a fake credit card provided by stipe to complete the transaction.

I am a super visual person, so I like to start my projects by designing the application wireframe on my draw handbook with a pencil, nothing too fancy but for a visual person like me it makes a whole lot of difference, I feel like I have a goal to meet, like when I am doing a mockup of some website, the design is layout for me I just need to follow the patterns. 

I normally, use canva.com to translate my drawings from paper to a more visual approach, canva is also the place where I start to brainstorm the name and logo of the application. 

Thinking about some minors details brings a lot of character to my projects, like meaningful name or a logo, or changing the icon on the cursor when the user approaches a certain area of my application, this particular character can be seen throughout the entire application (like an easter egg, except I am the only one who knows about it ðŸ˜‚).

Furthermore, in this case specifically, I just had a new bourn so it was easy what the name of my app would be, after that I just create the Helena Charis store and the h-Charis logo. 

Following the design phase, I have a pretty good idea of what my components structure will look like. Since react is a unidirectional data flow methodology it is important to understand which components will hold state or if I should incorporate a state management tool like redux or simple enough, context API. 

Finally, it is code time!
